I wanted to keep master branch as simple as possible. So it is the bare minumum boilerplate.

I like ant design and use it almost wherever I can. I created another boilerplate for "antd-mobile". It is included in another branch called "antd-mobile". So simply

> git checkout antd-mobile

if you want to use beautiful ant design for Android and IOS projects.
